# Intro to React and React Hooks ✨

In this introductory React workshop, you will extend your frontend development knowledge beyond basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. React is one of the most popular and widely used frontend libraries and can be used to scale and elevate web applications. We will cover React fundamentals and set you up with everything you need to know to start your first React project. As a bonus, we’ll be covering React Hooks, which transform and simplify the way we write React applications!

For this workshop, we'll be building a **restaurant app**!

## Workshop Structure

### Introduction: What is React and Why do We Use It?

Here talk about a brief history of React and cover components and the virtual DOM.

### Basic React Features: Props, State, JSX, and Component Types 

Next we'll cover some of the basic features of React that will help us build our application.

### Getting Started: Create React App 

Now we can finally get started on our application with Create React App!

### Our First Component: Dish

Afterwards, we can create our first component for a dish using props and state.

### Adding Interactivity: Updating the State with a Button 

To show off some of the functionality of states, we'll make a button that will update it.

### Newer React Features: Refactoring with Hooks 

Finally, we'll explore a great new feature added to React, React Hooks.

## How to run the application

### Part 1: Basic React

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. 

### Part 2 and 3: Create React App and React Hooks

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start` or `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
